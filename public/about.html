<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I'm originally from Brazil, where I cultivated my love for aesthetics and design. With a Fashion Design background, I learned the art of blending form and style to create visually captivating experiences.</p>

<p>However, my curiosity led me to explore a new avenue and since I moved to the UK, I embarked on this exciting transition. I started studying Graphic Design. Then UX/Research because I wanted to understand more about how we can make decisions based on data. After that, I really wanted to know more about UI, and how to make more detailed-oriented layouts, use more of my creative side, and explore. And now my last adventure was learning how to code.</p>

<p>I'd love to be part of a place that not only allows me to expand my skills but also where I can contribute meaningfully. I thrive in collaborative environments, relishing the challenges alongside a team.
</p>

<p>Beyond the world of design, I have a profound love for animals, exploring interesting palettes of colors, indulging in delicious cuisines, discovering new beverages, and listening to some good music.</p>
